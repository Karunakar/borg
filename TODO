Features to implement
1. Remove migration dependency which is very specific to Solaro.
2. Add RSpec support
3. Two builds of the same project, should not be running parallely.
4. Track build times and ensure that failed builds run first.
5. Use require_relative rather than using require for loading files from relative directories.
6. Find out a way to determine run time of machines and distribute tests accordingly.
