1. We need Redis for this setup.

Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets


					==============================
					  2. Installation procedure
					==============================

Step 1 : Choose a machine where you want to run the borg server(for instance a Server with ip 172.18.0.8 in mycase).

Step 2 : We need a Redis server for this setup. So, install redis server and run the redis server on same machine( i.e IBM machine).
  Please refer http://redis.io/ to install the redis 
 
Step 3 : checkout your project with borg gem

Step 4 : Add a configuration file solaro/config/config.yml as per above server IP and push the code (server  IP is  : 172.18.0.8)

For instance
  redis_ip: "172.18.0.8"
  redis_port: 6379
  build_server_ip: "172.18.0.8"
  build_server_port: 10001

Step4 : Go to project folder and start the BORG server (i.e Server machine) as follows

            rake borg:start_server --trace > ~/server_log/borg_server.log 2>&1 &   # Start server

Step5 : Choose a Client machine and checkout project folder and run the Client

            rake borg:start_client --trace > log/borg_client.log 2>&1 & 

	You can run the client on the same server

Step6: Run the task rake borg:build and we can also add this task to cruise config. So it will run for every new push.

That's it . Now cruise runs on multiple machines.

Some important points to remember after finishing this process

* Please don't kill cruise process from HP or IBM server machines.

* make sure that all clients/workers should connect to server before you start the cruise.
